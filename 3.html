  <p>Reproductive success[edit]
  Evolutionary theory predicts that males would be apt to seek more mating partners than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from such a strategy.[98] Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies that allow them to acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners.[98] Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one femaleâ€™s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because the men have a longer reproductive window.[101][102]

  Breakup[edit]
  Serial monogamy has always been closely linked to divorce practices. Whenever procedures for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy, serial monogamy has been found.[103] As divorce has continued to become more accessible, more individuals have availed themselves of it, and many go on to remarry.[104] Barry Schwartz, author of The Paradox of Choice: Why less is more, further suggests that Western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice. It has been suggested, however, that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce, enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus serial monogamy.[105][10
